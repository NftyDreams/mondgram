# Mondgram

I created Mondgram to demonstrate how very small pieces of data can encapsulate beautiful images. Inspired by one of my favorite artists — [Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian) — Mondgram takes his unique style and incorporates it into a JavaScript code module. The module can render an infinite number of "Mondgram" artworks and a random emoji with each one. The intent is to demonstrate how a Smart Contract may use code to generate unique visual assets entirely on-chain.
